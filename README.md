# Cassava Leaf Disease Detection         

## Problem Statement
We would implement a Cassava Leaf Disease detection system.
Cassava is a rich, affordable source of carbohydrates. It can provide more calories per acre of the crop than cereal grain crops, which makes it a very useful crop in developing nations.          
              

As the 2nd largest provider of carbohydrates in Africa, cassava is a key food security crop grown by small-holder farmers because it can withstand harsh conditions. At least 80% of small-holder farmer households in Sub-Saharan Africa grow cassava and viral diseases are major sources of poor yields.              
             

We have taken 105 images for 4 leaf disease categories and a healthy category. Therefore, we have 5 categories of leaves.            
The Cassava Leaf Disease detection system would help the farmers to detect the disease correctly and take preventive measures for the same.       

### Successful predictions
